The first question that was asked for this blog was...

> **"Why did you decide to learn software development?"**.  

It seems like such a simple question but I feel like there have been so many steps that led to this point, that it feels hard to pinpoint an exact reason. 

I am currently a 28 year old High School Mathematics teacher. I have been teaching for four years. I became a teacher out of necessity to support my family. I come from a family of teachers so the transition to teaching was not difficult to adjust to. I have thought about coding throughout my life. I did some rudimentary coding in junior high; I was in robotics in highschool; then I went to college for economics and that idea seemed to slip away. 

This past year Covid has drastically changed the teaching environment, and has allowed me to reflect upon my life more. I had always found excuses. *I can not learn to code*, because I am dyslexic. *I can not learn to code*, becasue the career transition would be hard and I have to be able to support my husband and child. These are the false barriers that I used to tell myself. These reasons were excuses because I was scared to take a risk for something I would love. With the world struggling and changing due to the pandemic, I finally realized that life is full of risks, and sometimes the best things in them are worth that struggle.* I can learn to code*!

With that mindset I applied to the FlatIron self-directed program. I have been hesitant to do my first post because I wanted proof that I can do it. I am capable. I am about to start my first project and am excited to finally get there. I have friends and family supporting me along the way. 

So, when it comes to the question "Why did you decide to learn software development?”

> **I can say because I finally decided to do something I was interested in and take a leap of faith**.
